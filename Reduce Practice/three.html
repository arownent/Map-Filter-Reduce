    <!-- Question
    Suppose you have an array of objects representing items in a shopping cart, where each object has a price property. Write a function that uses reduce() to calculate the total price of all items in the cart. -->

    <script>
        const cart=[{name:"dauh", age:21},{name:"alis", age:5},{name:"kausyd", age:8},{name:"adyuf", age:200},{name:"lsaiuuft", age:0},{name:"kfdutwafdew", age:35},{name:"uewafd", age:99},{name:"ewau", age:20},{name:"iaytfd", age:16},{name:"dwatrd", age:45},{name:"ewuft", age:13},{name:"weald", age:7},{name:"wesdf", age:19},]

        const result = cart.reduce(((acc,curr)=>acc+curr.age),0)
        console.log(result);
